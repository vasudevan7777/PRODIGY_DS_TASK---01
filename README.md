Hi there!   
I'm **VASUDEVAN **, and this repository showcases my submission for **Task 1** of the **Prodigy Infotech Data Science Internship**. In this task, I explored a real-world dataset and used data analysis and visualization techniques to uncover some interesting patterns.

## üåç About the Dataset

I worked with the [**World Population Dataset**](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL), which contains population statistics of various countries as of 2022. Some of the key features in the dataset include:

- Total population  
- Yearly population change (%)
